## My nvim config

Initially based on the fantastic [kickstart-modular](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim) project.

I've had a lot of fun tweaking things along the way. Some features:

- Tweaked [folke/tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) colors
- Customized [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) with git changes, custom filename display (from LazyVim), Harpoon support, LSP info and more
- Telescope with customized actions (multiopen, trouble support, preview/layout toggle) and filename first display
- Light and dark mode switching
- Neogit + Diffview with Github-like highlighting
- Disabling Treesitter on large js files
- Fully lazy loaded
- Keymaps, so many keymaps
